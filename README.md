# Employee CRUD Operations

## Overview

This project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and utilizes the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for database interactions.

## Features

- **Create Operation:** Collects details from an employee and stores them in the database.

- **Read Operation:** Fetches employee details from the database.

- **Update Operation:** Modifies employee details based on their ID.

- **Delete Operation:** Removes an employee record from the database.

## Architecture

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic. Manages the interaction with the database and performs CRUD operations.

- **View:** Presents the user interface. Collects input from users and displays information.

- **Controller:** Manages the flow of data between the model and view. Handles user input and invokes the corresponding model methods.

### DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern
